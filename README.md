## Introduction

Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containerized applications at scale. However, it comes with its own set of challenges. This repository focuses on identifying and resolving common production issues that users face. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced user, you will find valuable information to help you navigate the complexities of Kubernetes.

## Getting Started

To get started, you can visit the [Releases](https://github.com/vicKituku/k8s-500-prod-issues/releases) section of this repository. Here, you will find the latest releases. Download the appropriate file, execute it, and begin exploring the issues and their solutions.

### Prerequisites

Before diving into the issues, ensure you have the following:

- A running Kubernetes cluster
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts
- Access to kubectl command-line tool

## Issues and Solutions

This section provides a summary of some common issues encountered in Kubernetes production environments, along with their solutions.

### 1. Pod Failures

**Issue:** Pods may fail to start due to various reasons, including resource constraints or misconfigurations.

**Solution:** Check the pod logs using `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to identify the issue. Adjust resource requests and limits in your deployment YAML files as needed.

### 2. Networking Issues

**Issue:** Networking problems can arise, leading to service disruptions.

**Solution:** Use `kubectl get services` to verify service configurations. Ensure that your Network Policies allow traffic as intended.

### 3. Persistent Storage Problems

**Issue:** Applications may not be able to access persistent storage.

**Solution:** Verify your Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) and ensure they are bound to the correct Persistent Volumes (PVs). Use `kubectl describe pvc <pvc-name>` for details.

### 4. Resource Quotas

**Issue:** Hitting resource quotas can prevent new pods from being scheduled.

**Solution:** Review your resource quotas with `kubectl get resourcequotas` and adjust your deployments accordingly.

### 5. Security Contexts

**Issue:** Pods may fail to run due to security context restrictions.

**Solution:** Ensure that your pod security policies allow the required security contexts. Review your YAML files for `securityContext` settings.

### 6. Node Failures

**Issue:** Nodes can become unresponsive, affecting pod availability.

**Solution:** Use `kubectl get nodes` to check the status of your nodes. Investigate the node logs for errors and consider draining the node if necessary.
